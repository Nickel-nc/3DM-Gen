  OVERVIEW
............
Find:
- The orientation of the hexapod (normal axis of the hexapod body plane)
- distance of hexapod center of gravity to the ground plane (height)
- All the legs which are in contact in the ground
How?
We have 18 points total.
(6 legs, three possible points per leg (femurPoint))
We have a total of 540 combinations
- get three legs out of six (20 combinations)
  - we have three possible points for each leg,
        (coxiaPoint, femurPoint, footTip),
        that's 27 (3^3) combinations
  -  27 * 20 is 540
For each combination:
    1. Check if stable. If not, try the next combination
      - Check if the projection of the center of gravity to the plane
        defined by the three points lies inside the triangle,
        if not stable, try the next combination
    2. Get the HEIGHT and normal of the height and normal of the triangle plane
        (We need this for the next part)
    3. For each of the three legs, check if the two other points on the leg is not
        lower than HEIGHT, (6 points total)
        if condition if broken, try the next combination.
    4. For each of the three other legs, check if all points (3 points of each leg)
        are not lower than HEIGHT
        if this condition is broken, try the next combination. (9 points total)
    5. If no condition is violated, then this is good, return this!
